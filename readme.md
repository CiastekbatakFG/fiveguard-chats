**Fiveguard Staff Chat Dump from Jan 2022 to present**

This repository exposes internal Fiveguard chats. There are multiple instances of DDOSing among other illegal behaviour.
This also exposes their broken, laggy memory reading methods and goes to demonstrate the fact that you should never give money to these kids. 

Best part has to be Ciastekbatak informing Customers that they don't participate in DDOSing but it is quite literally done in their internal chats.
